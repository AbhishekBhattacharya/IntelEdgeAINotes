### OpenVINO toolkit:

- "Open Visual Inferencing and Neural Network Optimization"

-  By optimizing for model speed and size, OpenVINOâ„¢ enables running at the edge

Computer Vision Problems:
* Image Classification: Classify Image in classes

* Image Localization: Find location of Single Object in image

* Image Detection: Find Location of Multiple Objects and create bounding boxes on image

* Image Segmentation: create Segements in the image based on the pixel values
