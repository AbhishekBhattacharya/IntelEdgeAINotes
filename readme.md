### OpenVINO toolkit:

- "Open Visual Inferencing and Neural Network Optimization"

-  By optimizing for model speed and size, OpenVINO™ enables running at the edge

### Computer Vision Problems:
* Image Classification: Classify Image in classes

* Image Localization: Find location of Single Object in image

* Image Detection: Find Location of Multiple Objects and create bounding boxes on image

* Image Segmentation: create Segements in the image based on the pixel values 


### Comon Computer Vision Architectures:

* #### SSD #### is an object detection network that combined classification with object detection through the use of default bounding boxes at different network levels. 

* #### ResNet #### utilized residual layers to “skip” over sections of layers, helping to avoid the vanishing gradient problem with very deep neural networks. 

* #### MobileNet #### utilized layers like 1x1 convolutions to help cut down on computational complexity and network size, leading to fast inference without substantial decrease in accuracy.
