### In this lesson we'll cover:
- Basics of OpenCV
- Handling Input Streams in OpenCV
- Processing Model Outputs for Additional Useful Information
- The Basics of MQTT and their use with IoT devices
- Sending statistics and video streams to a server
- Performance basics
- And finish up by thinking about additional model use cases, as well as end user needs

## OpenCV Basics
OpenCV is an open-source library for various image processing and computer vision techniques that runs on a highly optimized C++ back-end, although it is available for use with Python and Java as well. It‚Äôs often helpful as part of your overall edge applications, whether using it‚Äôs built-in computer vision techniques or handling image processing.
### Uses of OpenCV

There‚Äôs a lot of uses of OpenCV. In your case, you‚Äôll largely focus on its ability to capture and read frames from video streams, as well as different pre-processing techniques, such as resizing an image to the expected input size of your model. It also has other pre-processing techniques like converting from one color space to another, which may help in extracting certain features from a frame. There are also plenty of computer vision techniques included, such as Canny Edge detection, which helps to extract edges from an image, and it extends even to a suite of different machine learning classifiers for tasks like face detection.
### Useful OpenCV function
- `VideoCapture` - can read in a video or image and extract a frame from it for processing
- `resize` is used to resize a given frame
- `cvtColor` can convert between color spaces.
	- You may remember from awhile back that TensorFlow models are usually trained with RGB images, while OpenCV is going to load frames as BGR. There was a technique with the Model Optimizer that would build the TensorFlow model to appropriately handle BGR. If you did not add that additional argument at the time, you could use this function to convert each image to RGB, but that‚Äôs going to add a little extra processing time.
- `rectangle` - useful for drawing bounding boxes onto an output image
- `imwrite` - useful for saving down a given image

üí´ OpenCV can be used for
- Capturing a video stream
- Image pre-processing (re-sizing, converting between color spaces, etc.)
- Detecting features like edges or lines
- Drawing or writing on an image

## Handling Input Streams
Being able to efficiently handle video files, image files, or webcam streams is an important part of an edge application. If I were to be running the webcam on my Macbook for instance and performing inference, a surprisingly large amount of resources get used up simply to use the webcam. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs useful to utilize the OpenCV functions built for this - they are about as optimized for general use with input streams as you will find.

### Open & Read A Video

We saw the `cv2.VideoCapture` function in the previous video. This function takes either a zero for webcam use, or the path to the input image or video file. That‚Äôs just the first step, though. This ‚Äúcapture‚Äù object must then be opened with `capture.open`.

Then, you can basically make a loop by checking if `capture.isOpened`, and you can read a frame from it with `capture.read`. This `read` function can actually return two items, a boolean and the frame. If the boolean is false, there‚Äôs no further frames to read, such as if the video is over, so you should `break` out of the loop

### Closing the Capture

Once there are no more frames left to capture, there‚Äôs a couple of extra steps to end the process with OpenCV.

-  First, you‚Äôll need to `release` the capture, which will allow OpenCV to release the captured file or stream
- Second, you‚Äôll likely want to use `cv2.destroyAllWindows`. This will make sure any additional windows, such as those used to view output frames, are closed out
- Additionally, you may want to add a call to `cv2.waitKey` within the loop, and break the loop if your desired key is pressed. For example, if the key pressed is 27, that‚Äôs the Escape key on your keyboard - that way, you can close the stream midway through with a single button. Otherwise, you may get stuck with an open window that‚Äôs a bit difficult to close on its own.

## Gathering Useful Information from Model Outputs
Training neural networks focuses a lot on accuracy, such as detecting the right bounding boxes and having them placed in the right spot. But what should you actually do with bounding boxes, semantic masks, classes, etc.? How would a self-driving car make a decision about where to drive based solely off the semantic classes in an image?

It‚Äôs important to get useful information from your model - information from one model could even be further used in an additional model, such as traffic data from one set of days being used to predict traffic on another set of days, such as near to a sporting event.

For the traffic example, you‚Äôd likely want to count how many bounding boxes there are, but also make sure to only count once for each vehicle until it leaves the screen. You could also consider which part of the screen they come from, and which part they exit from. Does the left turn arrow need to last longer near to a big event, as all the cars seem to be heading in that direction?

## Intro to MQTT

### MQTT

MQTT stands for MQ Telemetry Transport, where the MQ came from an old IBM product line called IBM MQ for Message Queues (although MQTT itself does not use queues). That doesn‚Äôt really give many hints about its use.

MQTT is a lightweight publish/subscribe architecture that is designed for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth setups. It is used a lot for Internet of Things devices, or other machine-to-machine communication, and has been around since 1999. Port 1883 is reserved for use with MQTT.

### Publish/Subscribe

In the publish/subscribe architecture, there is a broker, or hub, that receives messages published to it by different clients. The broker then routes the messages to any clients subscribing to those particular messages.

This is managed through the use of what are called ‚Äútopics‚Äù. One client publishes to a topic, while another client subscribes to the topic. The broker handles passing the message from the publishing client on that topic to any subscribers. These clients therefore don‚Äôt need to know anything about each other, just the topic they want to publish or subscribe to.

MQTT is one example of this type of architecture, and is very lightweight. While you could publish information such as the count of bounding boxes over MQTT, you cannot publish a video frame using it. Publish/subscribe is also used with self-driving cars, such as with the Robot Operating System, or ROS for short. There, a stop light classifier may publish on one topic, with an intermediate system that determines when to brake subscribing to that topic, and then that system could publish to another topic that the actual brake system itself subscribes to.

### Communicating with MQTT
There is a useful Python library for working with MQTT called paho-mqtt. Within, there is a sub-library called client, which is how you create an MQTT client that can publish or subscribe to the broker.

To do so, you‚Äôll need to know the IP address of the broker, as well as the port for it. With those, you can connect the client, and then begin to either publish or subscribe to topics.

Publishing involves feeding in the topic name, as well as a dictionary containing a message that is dumped to JSON. Subscribing just involves feeding in the topic name to be subscribed to.

üí´ code used for publishing or subscribing to a ‚Äùstudents‚Äù topic (given a MQTT client and some data).

- Publish:  `client.publish("students", data)`
- Subscribe:  `client.subscribe("students")`

## Streaming Images to a Server
Sometimes, you may still want a video feed to be streamed to a server. A security camera that detects a person where they shouldn‚Äôt be and sends an alert is useful, but you likely want to then view the footage. Since MQTT can‚Äôt handle images, we have to look elsewhere.

At the start of the course, we noted that network communications can be expensive in cost, bandwidth and power consumption. Video streaming consumes a ton of network resources, as it requires a lot of data to be sent over the network, clogging everything up. Even with high-speed internet, multiple users streaming video can cause things to slow down. As such, it‚Äôs important to first consider whether you even need to stream video to a server, or at least only stream it in certain situations, such as when your edge AI algorithm has detected a particular event.

### FFmpeg

Of course, there are certainly situations where streaming video is necessary. The [FFmpeg library](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is one way to do this. The name comes from ‚Äúfast forward‚Äù MPEG, meaning it‚Äôs supposed to be a fast way of handling the MPEG video standard (among others).

In our case, we‚Äôll use the `ffserver` feature of FFmpeg, which, similar to MQTT, will actually have an intermediate FFmpeg server that video frames are sent to. The final Node server that displays a webpage will actually get the video from that FFmpeg server.

There are other ways to handle streaming video as well. In Python, you can also use a flask server to do some similar things, although we‚Äôll focus on FFmpeg here.

### Setting up FFmpeg

You can download FFmpeg from ffmpeg.org. Using `ffserver` in particular requires a configuration file that we will provide for you. This config file sets the port and IP address of the server, as well as settings like the ports to receive video from, and the framerate of the video. These settings can also allow it to listen to the system stdout buffer, which is how you can send video frames to it in Python.

### Sending frames to FFmpeg

With the `sys` Python library, can use `sys.stdout.buffer.write(frame)` and `sys.stdout.flush()` to send the frame to the `ffserver` when it is running.

If you have a `ffmpeg` folder containing the configuration file for the server, you can launch the `ffserver` with the following from the command line:

`sudo ffserver -f ./ffmpeg/server.conf`

From there, you need to actually pipe the information from the Python script to FFmpeg. To do so, you add the `|` symbol after the python script (as well as being after any related arguments to that script, such as the model file or CPU extension), followed by `ffmpeg` and any of its related arguments.

For example:

`python app.py -m ‚Äúmodel.xml‚Äù | ffmpeg -framerate 24`

And so on with additional arguments before or after the pipe symbol depending on whether they are for the Python application or for FFmpeg.

üí´ Given additional network impacts of streaming full video, why might it still be useful to be streaming video back to another server, given AI applied at the edge?

Your reflection
We can take the example of self-driving cars. If the car encounters an accident it can send the data to the cloud so that the model can be updated with that video feed so that the model will not make the mistake again.

Things to think about
Thanks for your response! Think of a security camera - it‚Äôs great it identified there is a potential break-in, and now I probably want to see the footage of that camera.

## Handling Statistics and Images from a Node Server
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) is an open-source environment for servers, where Javascript can be run outside of a browser. Consider a social media page, for instance - that page is going to contain different content for each different user, based on their social network. Node allows for Javascript to run outside of the browser to gather the various relevant posts for each given user, and then send those posts to the browser.

In our case, a Node server can be used to handle the data coming in from the MQTT and FFmpeg servers, and then actually render that content for a web page user interface.

## Analyzing Performance Basics
We‚Äôve talked a lot about optimizing for inference and running apps at the edge, but it‚Äôs important not to skip past the accuracy of your edge AI model. Lighter, quicker models are helpful for the edge, and certain optimizations like lower precision that help with these will have some impact on accuracy, as we discussed earlier on.

No amount of skillful post-processing and attempting to extract useful data from the output will make up for a poor model choice, or one where too many sacrifices were made for speed.

Of course, it all depends on the exact application as to how much loss of accuracy is acceptable. Detecting a pet getting into the trash likely can handle less accuracy than a self-driving car in determining where objects are on the road.

The considerations of speed, size and network impacts are still very important for AI at the Edge. Faster models can free up computation for other tasks, lead to less power usage, or allow for use of cheaper hardware. Smaller models can also free up memory for other tasks, or allow for devices with less memory to begin with. We‚Äôve also discussed some of the network impacts earlier. Especially for remote edge devices, the power costs of heavy network communication may significantly hamper their use,

Lastly, there can be other differences in cloud vs edge costs other than just network effects. While potentially lower up front, cloud storage and computation costs can add up over time. Data sent to the cloud could be intercepted along the way. Whether this is better or not at the edge does depend on a secure edge device, which isn‚Äôt always the case for IoT.

üí´ performance improvements experienced when deploying with OpenVINO‚Ñ¢ and deploying at the edge
- Less impact on the network
- Faster inference
- Smaller model size

## Model Use Cases
It‚Äôs important to think about any additional use cases for a given model or application you build, which can reach far beyond the original training set or intended use. For example, object detection can be used for so many things, and focusing on certain classes along with some post-processing can lead to very different applications.

üí´ What are some use cases you can think of for a model that detects where the attention of someone on camera is directed at?

What are some use cases you can think of for a model that detects where the attention of someone on camera is directed at?

Your reflection
We can use this type of model for targeted ads for the user. let it be on a screen or a shopping mall or any other store where we can get the attention data and we are selling something.

we can use this model for the attentiveness of a driver on the road and we can inform the driver when he is not paying attention on the road. we can use this model in self-driving cars when the driver is not paying attention we can automatically turn on the autonomous mode.

Things to think about
Thanks for your response! One use case I thought of was in detecting distracted drivers.

## Concerning End User Needs

If you are building an app for certain end users, it‚Äôs very important to consider their needs. Knowing their needs can inform the various trade-offs you make regarding model decisions (speed, size, accuracy, etc.), what information to send to servers, security of information, etc. If they have more resources available, you might go for a higher accuracy but more resource-intensive app, while an end user with remote, low-power devices will likely have to sacrifice some accuracy for a lighter, faster app, and need some additional considerations about network usage.

This is just to get you thinking - building edge applications is about more than just models and code.

## Lesson Glossary

### OpenCV

A computer vision (CV) library filled with many different computer vision functions and other useful image and video processing and handling capabilities.

### MQTT

A publisher-subscriber protocol often used for IoT devices due to its lightweight nature. The `paho-mqtt` library is a common way of working with MQTT in Python.

### Publish-Subscribe Architecture

A messaging architecture whereby it is made up of publishers, that send messages to some central broker, without knowing of the subscribers themselves. These messages can be posted on some given ‚Äútopic‚Äù, which the subscribers can then listen to without having to know the publisher itself, just the ‚Äútopic‚Äù.

### Publisher

In a publish-subscribe architecture, the entity that is sending data to a broker on a certain ‚Äútopic‚Äù.

### Subscriber

In a publish-subscribe architecture, the entity that is listening to data on a certain ‚Äútopic‚Äù from a broker.

### Topic

In a publish-subscribe architecture, data is published to a given topic, and subscribers to that topic can then receive that data.

### FFmpeg

Software that can help convert or stream audio and video. In the course, the related `ffserver` software is used to stream to a web server, which can then be queried by a Node server for viewing in a web browser.

### Flask

A [Python framework](https://www.fullstackpython.com/flask.html) useful for web development and another potential option for video streaming to a web browser.

### Node Server

A web server built with Node.js that can handle HTTP requests and/or serve up a webpage for viewing in a browser.
